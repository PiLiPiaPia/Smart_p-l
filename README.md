```javascript
const config = {
  user: USERNAME,
  password: PASSWORD,
  host: SERVER_HOST,
  port: MONGODB_PORT,
  db: DB_NAME
};

if (process.env.MOCHA_TEST) {
  config.db = TEST_DB_NAME;
}

module.exports = config;
```

### deployment

there are a few `.sh` files to help simplify the deployment procedure. Just follow the instructions below:

1. `./install.sh`
2. `./build.sh`
3. `./start.sh`

and the website will be perfectly deployed listening port 8080! Now you can access the website using browser by URL `http://YOUR_SERVER_HOST:8080`.
